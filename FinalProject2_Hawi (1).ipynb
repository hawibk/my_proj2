It is plausible that improvement of Cx43 delivery and GJC formation in cell surface might be helpful in restoring the perturbed homeostasis during virus induced neuroinflammation and might induce cessation of chronic expansion of demyelinated plaques.

Arenavirus NPs possess 3′-5′ exonuclease activity and are proposed to degrade viral dsRNA or ssRNA to reduce the exposure of viral RNA to RIG-I and MDA-5. Z protein of the New World arenavirus, but not of the Old World arenavirus, inhibits RIG-I signaling cascade probably as a result of its direct binding to RIG-I protein. NP further interacts with IKKε and inhibits TBK-1/ IKKε activation to interfere with phosphorylation and activation of IRF-3 or IRF-7. NP prevents activation of NF-κB. It is still unclear whether suppression of TBK-1/ IKKε complex by NP could directly lead to inhibition of NF-κB activation.

Mapping of the 4B6 epitope using gD-tagged fragments of 108060-rgp120. Binding of 4B6 to various fragments of the 108060 envelope protein was assayed by ELISA. All fragments were bound by the positive control antibody to the gD tag ( Amino acid sequence alignment of V1/V2 domains from gp120s used for 4B6 binding studies. The binding of 4B6 to gp120s from 17 different isolates was measured by ELISA. The gp120s able to bind 4B6 are indicated by plus signs (+) and those unable to bind are indicated by minus (−) signs). The sequences of all of the gp120s were aligned using MAFFT [33] . The location of the N130 PNGSs that matched the pattern of 4B6 binding is indicated by white on black lettering.

The proposed reservoirs for both Ebola and Marburg viruses are a number of species of African fruit bats. Multiple outbreaks have been associated with locations where contact with or the consumption of bats has occurred. Contact with infected nonhuman primates, typically as bush meat, has also been a suspected source of infection. While the mechanism of transmission from bats to humans and nonhuman primates is not known, transmission from nonhuman primates to humans is likely through contact with blood and tissues during butchering or from bites and scratches. Transmission between humans probably occurs via direct contact with blood or secretions; however, there is limited evidence of aerosol transmission. In the event of an act of bioterrorism the most likely route of infection would be by the aerosol route.', 4], ['† Provides a quantitative approach to classifying the potential of a microbe as a biological warfare agent. † Can be applied to newly discovered microbial pathogens to assess their potential as biological warfare agents relative to known agents. Consider the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)associated coronavirus [12] . Estimates of the virulence of a biological weapon (V BW ) can be made from literature sources. The report of 22 cases of SARS among 119 individuals traveling in an airplane carrying a symptomatic patient with SARS yields a fraction symptomatic (F SI ) of 0.18 assuming that every individual in the plane was exposed to virus-contaminated air [18] . This value is consistent with the attack rates of 10.3 -60% that were recorded among intensive care nurses during the outbreak in Toronto, Canada [19] . The inoculum needed for human infection is unknown but for the purposes of the calculation we will assume a value of 1000 viral particles. This estimate is inferred from the dose of coronavirus needed to induce an immunological response in cats infected lintratracheally [20] . However, this inoculum might be an overestimate, given that for another coronavirus a dose of 112 plaque forming units is 10LD 50 [21] . The communicability (C) of SARS was considered high and a value of 50 was used, which might be also an underestimate. Because the SARS agent is a virus we use a stability factor of 0.25 to be consistent with the other viruses that are mentioned in Table I in Box 1 within the main text, although this value might also be an underestimate because the survival ability of SARS coronavirus has been described as strong [22] . The time between exposure and disease for SARS ranges from 1 to 20 days with a mean duration of 5.9 days [23] . From these numbers one can calculate a WP as follows: WP ¼ (0.18/1000)(50)(0.25)(1/5.9) ¼ 3.5 £ 10 24 . On the basis of this estimate one could conclude that SARS coronavirus has a weapon potential that is intermediate between variola and Bacillus anthracis. When one reviews the numbers, it is clear that the data for F SI and the time to disease are robust from the intensive epidemiological investigation that followed the SARS outbreak, whereas data for inoculum, stability and communicability are lacking and necessitate extrapolation and estimation. Therefore, the formula also serves to identify areas that need to be studied to properly assess the WP of certain microbes. † Suggests direction for future research for developing treatments and preventative measures for agents of bioterror. † Provides an educational tool by delineating the parameters that contribute to making some microbes biological weapons.', 4], [\"Ã Cyberwarrefers to hostile attacks and illegal invasions of computer systems and networks.

These symptoms include muscular tension, headaches, palpitations, sleep deprivation, hypertension, tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, tremors, and other non-specific signs and symptoms. 35 Fear of exposure to biological agents may lead to episodes of medically unexplained epidemic illness (also known as mass sociogenic illness, mass psychogenic illness, or mass hysteria), involving the rapid spread of medically unexplained signs and symptoms, which are misinterpreted by affected persons as signs of serious physical illness. 8 From a social psychology point of view, general social interventions are recommended in order to diminish the development of psychopathological consequences. They include re-establishment of normal cultural and religious, and other common interest activities, assuming these activities are safe. 8 The potential for new, larger, and more sophisticated attacks has created a sense of vulnerability. According to the role delineation model there are several types of victims: primary victims are people directly exposed to the disaster; secondary victims are people with close family and personal ties to primary victims; tertiary victims are people whose occupations require them to respond to the disaster; and quaternary victims are concerned and caring members of communities beyond the impact area. As a result, these groups should be considered separately in mental health interventions in emergency situations. 10 Normative postdisaster reactions of individuals and communities form a relatively predictable pattern from the onset of the disaster through the subsequent 18-36 months. 36 Biological weapons induce loss of confidence in the authorities. People have to learn to live with the threat of biological terrorism. Once they lose their novelty, biological weapons will lose their primary potency-the capacity to cause fear.

Transmission of SARS-CoV occurred mainly after days of illness 2 and was associated with modest viral loads in the respiratory tract early in the illness, with viral loads peaking approximately 10 days after symptom onset. 3 We monitored SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in upper respiratory specimens obtained from 18 patients (9 men and 9 women; median age, 59 years; range, 26 to 76) in Zhuhai, Guangdong, China, including 4 patients with secondary infections (1 of whom never had symptoms) within two family clusters (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). The patient who never had symptoms was a close contact of a patient with a known case and was therefore monitored. A total of 72 nasal swabs (sampled from the mid-turbinate and nasopharynx) (Fig. 1A) and 72 throat swabs (Fig. 1B) were analyzed, with 1 to 9 sequential samples obtained from each patient. Polyester flock swabs were used for all the patients. From January 7 through January 26, 2020, a total of 14 patients who had recently returned from Wuhan and had fever (≥37.3°C) received a diagnosis of Covid-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) by means of reverse-transcriptasepolymerase-chain-reaction assay with primers and probes targeting the N and Orf1b genes of SARS-CoV-2; the assay was developed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Samples were tested at the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Pre- We analyzed the viral load in nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients in relation to day of onset of any symptoms (Fig. 1C) . Higher viral loads (inversely related to Ct value) were detected soon after symptom onset, with higher viral loads detected in the nose than in the throat. Our analysis suggests that the viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of patients with influenza 4 and appears different from that seen in patients infected with SARS-CoV. 3 The viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which suggests the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients. These findings are in concordance with reports that transmission may occur early in the course of infection 5 and suggest that case detection and isolation may require strategies different from those required for the control of SARS-CoV. How SARS-CoV-2 viral load correlates with culturable virus needs to be determined. Identification of patients with few or no symptoms and with modest levels of detectable viral RNA in the oropharynx for at least 5 days suggests that we need better data to determine transmission dynamics and inform our screening practices.

The use of noninvasive ventilation in these patients may decrease the need for intubation and improve the poor outcome associated with these complications. • Continuous positive airway pressure has been used to treat acute respiratory failure in several conditions characterised by alveolar collapse.

In contrast, NATs have yet to have an established role for several important bacterial pneumonia pathogens (e.g. S. pneumoniae) that also are asymptomatic colonizers of the upper respiratory tract. • Further developments in molecular tests need to focus on methods to help interpret the significance of positive results. The use of quantitative NATs and microbial load cutoffs has shown promise as one means to discriminate between colonizing and pathogenic microorganisms. • The recent revelation that the lung microbiome exists and new knowledge about the interaction between bacteria and viruses has changed the traditional view of pneumonia pathogenesis.

Our results suggest that pregnant women may experience more fatigue and require more rest breaks from mask use. Scheduled work breaks should be considered for pregnant healthcare workers working in high risk areas which require prolonged use of N95 respirators. In face of the imminent threat of pandemic airborne respiratory diseases it should be emphasized that the benefit of using N95 mask to prevent serious emerging infectious diseases should be weighed against possible respiratory consequences associated with N95 mask usage.

METHODS: To test this hypothesis, children enrolled in the Childhood Origins of ASThma (COAST) project provided nasal lavage samples during symptomatic respiratory infections and at scheduled well visits at ages 5 and 6 years. Children with a history of wheezing were sampled when well, during an uncomplicated cold and during a wheezing illness.

Interleukin-8 levels were evaluated by ELISA. RESULTS: Interleukin-6, IL-10, IFN-g, and IL-8 were present in measurable concentrations. Concentrations of IL-6 were significantly higher during symptomatic RV infection than when well (14.6 vs. 9.91, p<0.001).

However, horizontal transmission between cats was not observed, although infected cats had been introduced into a large cat population that had other viral and bacterial infections and lived under stressful conditions. Avian flu infection in cats is rarely documented and there is no evidence to date that cats are responsible for transmitting the virus to humans. Although this study does not rule out H5N1 infection leading to disease and possible transmission to other mammals and birds by domestic cats under natural conditions, without ingestion of infected birds, cats do not represent a major risk in the epidemiology of H5N1 influenza. The risk posed by cats could change because the virus can rapidly undergo genetic mutation and reassortment, and efforts should be made to minimize contact of domestic cats with infected birds.

The prevalence of individual viruses vary from study to study (see Table 1 ), likely due to differences in seasonality of sample collection, variation in local virus circulation, and methodological choices (eg, sample type, sample preparation). The studies reviewed here demonstrate that HTS and expanded panels of PCR assays can identify rare viral pathogens that might not be included in multiplex diagnostic panels or PCR panels in which only the most common pathogens or viruses of interest are selected. The relatively unbiased sequencing approach can also reveal viruses that may not directly cause respiratory illness but whose presence may impact the trajectory of illness through mechanisms we do not yet understand. Methodological improvements to virus detection will help us better define the respiratory tract virome and monitor outbreaks. In the future, clinical tests may include both pathogen detection and an assessment of host response in order to more clearly distinguish viral and bacterial infections.', 6], [\"We appreciate the comments and perspective expressed by Dr. Strauss regarding our recent pandemic contingency guidance, 1 and we agree that in the setting of acute severe asthma or impending respiratory failure, both nebulized albuterol and subcutaneous terbutaline are important clinical considerations. Although evidence suggests that inhaled albuterol through a metered dose inhaler can be as effective as nebulized albuterol, alternative bronchodilator delivery may be needed in some situations. 2, 3 Although subcutaneous terbutaline may be an option, if nebulized therapy is required due to patient impairment and ineffective drug delivery by the metered dose inhaler, it would be an appropriate consideration if felt to be essential in patient management. In this context, for a patient with potential SARS-CoV-2 infection, it would be appropriate to consider administering nebulized therapy in a negative pressure room with appropriate airborne precautions-complete personal protective equipment (PPE) including an N95 respirator. 1 In the setting of acute severe asthma, it is important to ensure availability of emergency medical services and/or additional intensive care resources that may be required for patient management, including supplemental oxygen, aggressive bronchodilator therapies (both intramuscular and intravenous beta-agonists, anticholinergics, and other smooth muscle inhibitors including magnesium sulfate), anti-inflammatory medications including early administration of corticosteroids, and supportive measures such as noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and helium-oxygen gas mixtures. 4 Terbutaline is a beta-agonist that preferentially stimulates beta-2 receptors in the bronchi to a greater degree than beta-1 receptors in the heart. Although terbutaline is effective at a dose of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) subcutaneously in adult patients presenting with acute severe asthma, it is also notable that epinephrine at a dose of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) has been shown to have similar benefit with a comparable adverse effect profile. 5, 6 Dosing of subcutaneous terbutaline and subcutaneous epinephrine is similar (0.01 mg/ kg/dose), with an adult dose of 0.25 mg for terbutaline and 0.3 to 0.5 mg for epinephrine every 20 minutes for 3 doses recommended by the 3rd Expert Panel Report (EPR3). 7, 8 Notably, when administered subcutaneously, evidence suggests that terbutaline loses its beta-selectivity and offers little advantage over epinephrine, 6 which may be more readily available in many office settings; however, terbutaline subcutaneously may be preferred over subcutaneous epinephrine in pregnancy. 9 In addition, if both subcutaneous epinephrine and terbutaline are available, terbutaline may be preferred as its effect on forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity may be more pronounced and of longer duration as a result of its slower rate of inactivation, because it is not metabolized by either catechol-o-methyl transferase or monoamine oxidase as is epinephrine. 6 The recently released GINA guidelines 10 and EPR3 8 recommend nebulized or inhaled short-acting beta-agonists for the initial treatment of acute asthma exacerbation; EPR3 stated that injected epinephrine or terbutaline had ''no proven advantage'' compared with aerosol therapy. 8 Properly designed studies demonstrating superior therapeutic utility of terbutaline for acute asthma are required to alter this recommendation; however, in the setting of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the need to implement droplet and situational airborne precautions, administration of injected bronchodilator therapy may merit consideration. The benefits of using subcutaneous terbutaline or subcutaneous epinephrine in acute severe asthma may outweigh the increased risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection by nebulizer therapy, especially in an increasingly common scenario of PPE shortages throughout North America. Importantly, when delivering bronchodilator therapy in the setting of acute asthma, supplemental oxygen may be needed because approximately one-third of patients may experience a decrease in PaO 2 , and patients who are already hypoxic may be at greater risk due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch. 6 In this setting, beta-agonists may increase perfusion relative to ventilation through cardiac output and pulmonary vasodilation. 6 In the context of supplemental oxygen therapy, recommendations for PPE for patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection would also apply. 1 During the COVID-19 pandemic, each clinician must treat the patient in front of him or her, managing each unique situation in its appropriate context. Although subcutaneous beta-agonists may have a role in managing some asthma exacerbations during the pandemic, COVID-19 is not an absolute contraindication to any medication or management strategy urgently needed in delivering optimal care. Still, Dr. Strauss highlights an important and often overlooked aspect in the management of acute asthma exacerbations and we greatly appreciate this insight. 121  122  123  124  125  126  127  128  129  130  131  132  133  134  135  136  137  138  139  140  141  142  143  144  145  146  147  148  149  150  151  152  153  154  155  156  157  158  159  160  161  162  163  164  165  166  167  168  169  170  171  172  173  174  175  176  177  178  179  180  181 \", 6]]\n",

Simultaneously, many fundamental questions remain or have become evident from this work. Among these unresolved questions are the detailed molecular mechanisms by which specific viruses target their replication factors and their RNAs to particular membranes or other intracellular sites to assemble replication complexes or factories, as well as how different viruses orchestrate the varied and often complex membrane rearrangements associated with their replication processes. Related issues include the specific advantages or adaptations associated with the use by diverse viruses of different intracellular sites for similar replication purposes. Different positive-strand RNA viruses, e.g., variously assemble their RNA replication complexes on distinct secretory, endosomal, or organellar membranes, and they and other viruses show a similar diversity in the sites used for virion assembly and/or budding. However, the implications of such choices for replicative efficiency, virus-host interactions, and pathology remain poorly understood. Recent findings on how picornaviruses, flaviviruses and coronaviruses manipulate components of the secretory pathway and related pathways to create novel membrane environments with specific lipid enrichments and other replication-supportive characteristics are examples of these essential research directions (Belov et al., 2007; Hsu et al., 2010; Reggiori et al., 2010) . Such efforts will be critical to identify and understand the roles of cellular factors and molecular pathways in efficient viral replication. A second class of challenges and opportunities is associated with using growing knowledge in these areas to improve virus control or beneficial uses of viruses. For virus control, growing recognition of the intimate coordination of many successive virus replication steps with each other and with cellular pathways offers many additional points at which to disrupt infection. In this regard, one important area will be further defining the roles and interactions of viral replication compartments as barriers to host defenses, including host systems for detecting viruses through dsRNA, etc., and for impeding virus replication, such as through RNA silencing or certain interferon-stimulated pathways. Though the emerging complexities exceed the expectations of earlier stages of investigation, such questions offer challenging but satisfying directions and a fulfilling future for these important areas in the cell biology of virus replication.', 7], [\"mRNA expression of three ONC up-regulated genes (TXNIP, ATF3, and GADD45A) and two downregulated genes (PHGDH and ASNS) were examined by RT-qPCR. The same RNA samples used for microarrays analysis were used in this analysis. First, RNA samples were digested with DNase to prevent genomic contamination using the RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. They were evaluated using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA) and a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Then, for each sample, 0.5 μg of RNA was used to synthesize single-stranded cDNA with the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Gene-specific forward and reverse primers for the selected genes were designed with Primer3 (http://primer3.ut.ee) and checked with NetPrimer (http://www.premierbiosoft.com/netprimer/). Primer sequences for ONC-regulated genes were: TXNIP (F: GCTTGCGGAGTGGCTAAAGT; R: CTCACCTGTTGGCTGGTCTTC), ATF3 (F: AGTGAGT GCTTCTGCCATCGT; R: TGACAAAGGGCGTCAGG www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget TTAG), GADD45A (F: GAGAGCAGAAGACC GAAAGGA; R: CAGGCACAACACCACGTTATC), PHGDH (F: TATTGTTCGCTCTGCCACCA; R: TCATAACCAAGATGCCCTTCC) and ASNS (F: AAAGCCGAGGAGGAGAGTGA, R: GGTGGCAGAG ACAAGTAATAGGA). To select a constitutive gene as a reference for normalizing data, the transcription abundances of five genes (ACTB, GUSB, TBP, HPRT1, and ALAS1) were measured for all cDNA samples. Primer sequences are described in reference [28] . Among them, TBP showed the highest stability (lower standard deviation of the Ct; results not shown) and it was therefore selected for data normalization. Real-time PCRs were performed in an optical 96-well plate with an ABI PRISM 7300 Sequence Detector System (Applied Biosystems, USA), using SYBR Green to monitor dscDNA synthesis. Reactions contained 1x Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA), 300 nM of gene-specific forward primer, 300 nM of gene-specific reverse primer, and 5 μl of a 50fold dilution of the previously synthesized cDNA in a final volume of 20 μl. The following standard thermal profile was used for all real-time PCRs: 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, and 60°C for 1 min. A dissociation step was performed after amplification to confirm the presence of a single amplicon. To estimate variation in the technique, three technical replicates were carried out for each cDNA sample. Data were analyzed with the 7300 SDS 1.3.1 software (Applied Biosystems, USA). To generate a baseline-subtracted plot of the logarithmic increase in fluorescence signal (ΔRn) versus cycle number, baseline data were collected between cycles 3 and 15. All amplification plots were analyzed with an Rn threshold of 0.2 to obtain threshold cycle (Ct) values. The amplification efficiency for each gene was calculated based on five dilutions of cDNA ranging from 1 to 3.2x10 -4 and the equation E = 10 (−1/slope) . All genes had an efficiency value between 1.85 and 2.05. The relative transcription abundances (RTA) of ONCtarget genes (TXNIP, ATF3, GADD45A, PHGDH, and ASNS) were calculated as RTA = E ΔCt(control-sample) (Target) / E ΔCt(control-sample) (Reference) [100] , where control refers to a mix of equal amounts of untreated samples. Fold changes were calculated as the ratio between RTA values obtained for ONC-treated cells and those obtained for untreated cells. The absence of genomic DNA contamination was checked using non-retrotranscriptase controls and the absence of environmental contamination using nontemplate controls.\", 7], ['is assured.

The first glimpses of the fungal virome show that it is richer than previously V.V. Dolja, E.V. Koonin Virus Research 244 (2018) 36-52 expected. Given that fungi are ubiquitous organisms whose diversity and population sizes could be comparable to or exceed those of invertebrates, future deep sampling of fungi for viruses potentially could reveal major contributions of fungi to the formation of the eukaryotic RNA pan-virome. We have to admit that, despite the transformative impact of metaviromics on our understanding of RNA virus evolution, a unifying scenario that would explain the relationships between (+)RNA, (−) RNA, dsRNA and retroelements is still lacking. To develop such a grand scheme, major improvements are required in at least two directions: first, large-scale phylogenetic analysis of highly diverged proteins, such as the RdRps and RTs, and second, \\'evolutionary viromics\\', a systematic study of the viromes of all major host taxa. Furthermore, the possibility remains that further trawling of metagenomes, especially with most powerful methods for sequence similarity detection, results in the discovery of completely new groups of viruses within what currently looks like \"dark matter\" of RNA metagenomes. Such findings would have the potential to dramatically change the picture of RNA virus evolution.', 7], [\"Wildlife managers frequently perform wide scale ecological surveys, simultaneously collecting biological samples and data on the density and distribution of wildlife.

These findings suggest that the part of the norovirus capsid protein that binds to sugars on host cells is under heavy immune selection and evolves over time by antigenic drift. They show that, like influenza viruses, GII.4 viruses evolve through serial changes in the capsid sequence that occur sporadically after periods of stability, probably to evade the build up of immunity within the human population. Variation in this region of the viral genome is possible because human populations express a great variety of HBGA molecules so there is always likely to be a subpopulation of people that is susceptible to the altered virus. Overall, these findings suggest that it should be possible to develop vaccines to protect against norovirus infections but, just as with influenza virus, surveillance systems will have to monitor how the virus is changing and vaccines will need to be reformulated frequently to provide effective protection against norovirus outbreaks.

Further studies of CoVs from more bat species worldwide may, therefore, help provide additional clues to the origins of pathogenic hCoV-MERS. ', 7], [\"We have shown that with high-sequencing depth, short sequences can be used for de novo assembly of small DNA targets (e.g. viral genomes) that are up to 10's of kb in length. For larger and more complex sequencing targets, such as bacterial genomes, short reads can be rapidly and stringently assembled into contigs that accurately represent the non-repetitive portion of the genome. It is clear that the best approach for de novo sequencing of targets more complex than viral genomes will likely involve some combination of Sanger reads and assembled short reads. For metagenomics, our simulation involving 40 M short reads from the Sargasso Sea WGS data indicate that these types of reads can be used to produce conservative contigs in a robust and tractable manner, while minimizing probabilistic errors. As a stringent, efficient assembly tool SSAKE is expected to have broad application in de novo sequencing.

This belief was based on the fact that a single strain model, with the inclusion of variable transmission, has surprisingly flexible dynamics and thus may be able to fit ILI dynamics well even without biological correctness. Secondly, the introduction of multiple strains into a model adds many more parameters to the model, making it difficult to determine a prior distribution from historical data and increasing the problem of \"lack of determination\" in the model. However, there are regularly updated data on prevalence of specific strains provided by the WHO/NREVSS [6] and therefore, in retrospect, inclusion of multiple strains may be highly advantageous in the future. These data show that often there are one or two outbreaks of secondary dominant influenza strains in the late season. We hypothesize that these secondary strains are a primary cause of the heightened tail in the ILI data and we will investigate a multi-strain influenza model [56] in future forecasting work.', 7], ['We compiled the 1022 S1 gene sequences of Chinese IBV strains isolated from 1994 to 2014 and analysed these sequences by using MEGA 5.0. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed by using the maximum-likelihood method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The sequences were divided into different genotypes on the basis of this phylogenetic tree and the number of isolates in different groups was summed, respectively, to calculate the percentages of the respective genotypes. The variation trend line of the number of QX-like and vaccine (Mass)-like groups was reconstructed by using statistical methods.', 7], [\"We calculated the following summary statistics of genetic diversity: the number of polymorphic sites (S), the nucleotide diversity over loci (π) and Watterson's θ, defined as 4Neμ, where Ne is the effective population size and μ, the estimated mutation rate. We examined deviation from neutrality-equilibrium conditions using Tajima's D statistic [43] , Fu and Li's D and Fu and Li's F without an outgroup (also known as D* and F*) [44] and Fay and Wu's H [45] tests. Significance was assessed by comparing the observed values to 10 4 coalescent simulations, conditional on the observed sample size and on the value of S or on the value of θ, assuming a standard neutral model with no recombination. Deletions were excluded from all analyses. To see if deviation from selective neutrality can be found in specific regions of the gene, we also tested the 5' upstream regulatory region (which includes the non-coding P, Q SNP) and the exon 1 coding region separately. The heterogeneity in π values and Tajima's D statistic across the sequenced region was also examined by use of the sliding window feature of the DnaSP program. Statistics were calculated for overlapping windows of 60 bp, placed at 15 bp intervals along the sequence. Neutrality tests and sequence diversity parameters were calculated using the DnaSP version 4.10.1 software [46] .

The MEGA 3.1 program was used to construct the phylogenetic maximum parsimony tree with bootstrap test http:// www.megasoftware.net/. The time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of MBL2 was estimated using a relaxed molecular clock approach [48] . Evolutionary rate was modeled by the uncorrelated lognormal distribution and a coalescent prior (Bayesian skyline) was assigned to the tree. The average rate of molecular evolution of the MBL2 gene (1 × 10 -7 ) was obtained using a theta per site value of 0.0039 calculated for human sequences in DnaSP [46] and the estimate of human effective population size of 10,000 [49] . A normal prior with mean 1 × 10 -7 and standard deviation of 1 × 10 -7 was used for the rate of evolution. Divergence time inference was conducted in BEAST 1.4.8 [50] .

The introduction of sophisticated molecular and sequencing techniques has also facilitated our investigation of outbreaks and pseudo-outbreaks caused by unusual pathogens (Cheng et al., 2009a; Cheng et al., 2012c; To et al., 2013) . Because SARS affected a large number of healthcare workers with fatalities (Cooper et al., 2009) , their protection is an important aspect of infection control training, in addition to patient safety. Hand hygiene with the use of an alcohol-based hand rub has become a key infection control measure. We have further promoted hand hygiene by introducing a concept of directly-observed hand hygiene and electronic monitoring of compliance (Cheng et al., 2011a; Cheng et al., 2007b) , resulting in better control of endemic and sporadic pathogens in the hospital (Cheng et al., 2010a; Cheng et al., 2009c) . The concept of extensive contact tracing during the SARS outbreak has been harnessed for the control of multiple drug-resistant organisms which are not yet endemic in our healthcare setting (Cheng et al., 2009b; Cheng et al., 2012a) . Ten years after the SARS outbreak, our healthcare system is better prepared for the new challenges posed by known and unknown emerging pathogens.', 9], ['While these strategies have been used individually, future work can take advantage of their complementary nature. For instance, recent findings with MERS-CoV indicate its exploitation of α2,6-linked sialic acids acts as a secondary receptor through the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1, which is structurally conserved (Li et al., 2017) but divergent in sequence among CoVs (Fig. 2D) (Li et al., 2017; Walls et al., 2016a Walls et al., , 2016b Yuan et al., 2017) . Reverse genetics can be used to create mutants and chimeras to determine the effect sialic acid binding has on host tropism and to determine if this function of the NTD is conserved across similar zoonotic CoVs strains. Similarly, creating chimeric viruses through reverse genetics has already proven vital in the study of zoonotic viruses (Agnihothram et al., 2014b; Becker et al., 2008; Menachery et al., 2015 Menachery et al., , 2016 Sheahan et al., 2008) ; efforts to explore changes in the structure of proteins from zoonotic strains relative to the established strains may reveal structural requirements necessary for emergence. Reverse genetic and structural studies, by identifying conserved features associated with emergence and pathogenesis, can help identify which CoVs identified in animal populations are likely to pose a Fig. 3 . Dual approaches to leverage reverse genetics. Utilizing coronavirus molecular clones, two strategies have been employed to explore the emergence and pathogenic potential of sequences derived from zoonotic populations. A) Replacing the wild-type spike proteins, this strategy explores the capacity of the spike proteins within the context of a viral backbone known to be capable of replication. These studies provide insights into the potential of spike proteins to mediate infection of human cells and cause in vivo disease and aid in examinations of the broad efficacy of therapeutics directed against CoV spike proteins. B) Utilizing portions or whole spike proteins of replication-competent CoVs, this approach examines the capacity of the viral backbone in mediating infection and pathogenesis. These studies provide insights into whether the backbone has the capacity to infect and cause disease if paired with receptor binding/entry. This approach can also evaluate the efficacy of therapeutics targeting portions of the CoV genome other than spike. Both approaches have been used to examine bat viruses currently circulating in animal populations around the world. B.A. Johnson et al. Virology 517 (2018) 30-37 public health risk and merit further study. Additionally, insights from these strategies can be applied to existing experimental systems. For example, variation in host response to infection is currently a major area of research (Aylor et al., 2011; Menachery and Baric, 2013) and models of host genetic diversity, such as collaborative cross (CC) mouse panel, have identified genetic loci that modulate SARS-CoV disease outcome Xiong et al., 2014) . Applying insights from viral metagenomics, structure, and reverse genetics, offer the opportunity to utilize the CC to identify host genes that contribute to emergence of zoonotic CoVs. Similarly, host-pathogen interactions may influence and modulate both viral sequence and structure; reverse genetic systems can be utilized to confirm these hypotheses. Together, the synergistic use of metagenomics, structural biology, and reverse genetic systems has significant potential to identify the molecular determinates of CoV infection and pathogenesis. Integration of these three strategies can help characterize pre-emergent CoV populations, allowing to the field to make predictions about which zoonotic CoVs are likely to emerge, prepare for future outbreaks, and will facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies against CoV infection.', 9], ['We have provided evidence herein that favored CAV-mediated internalization during infection of MrNV. Firstly, the corresponding up-regulation between MrNV and CAV1 as well as their highly co-localized patterns under confocal microscopy at 2 h infection. Secondly, the results revealed the ability of tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitor, genistein, to virtually halt the internalization of MrNV particles, although specific inhibitors of other process within the endocytosis pathway need to be employed to provide conclusive evidence of the involvement of the CAV-mediated endocytosis pathway. Thirdly, MrNV infection could be quickly recovered and even further augmented by the pathway agonist okadaic acid (Figs. 3 and 4) . Applications of genistein and okadaic acid as a potent inhibitor and agonist, respectively, of the CAV-mediated endocytotic pathway have been reported in many previous studies, in particular those pertaining to viral infections (Damm et al., 2005; Parton et al., 1994; Thomsen et al., 2002) . These results correlate well with the findings in ssRNA+ viruses such as Human coronavirus 229E (Nomura et al., 2004) and Echovirus-1 (Marjomaki et al., 2002) which have been shown to be dependent on CAV-mediated endocytosis for internalization. While our results did suggest that MrNV infection in Sf9 cells were associated with the CAV-mediated endocytotic machinery, whether the viruses do internalize via caveosome-like structures at the ultra-high resolution microscopy is currently under investigation. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of using Sf9 insect cell line for MrNV replication and propagation, and that MrNV internalization favored more the CAV-mediated endocytostic pathway which would facilitate further detailed studies of MrNV infection/replication in this host cell line in the future. ence, Mahidol University under the National Research University Initiative (NRU).

SCI patients almost permanently need antimicrobial treatment and hence constitute a natural reservoir for the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This is due, in part, to the fact that most of them need urinary catheters, which can be used by bacteria to penetrate the bladder. Some of the bacteria that colonize these neuropathic bladders do not produce symptoms, and they are classified as benign colonizers, and, theoretically, bladder colonization by these bacteria could prevent infection by pathogenic microorganisms. In 1999 Richard Hull and his group studied the urinary tract colonization mechanisms used by bacteria associated with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU). They examined the virulence properties of E. coli 83972, a strain isolated from a clinical ABU episode (Hull et al. 1999) . They showed that this strain maintained the genetic potential to express both type P and type 1 pili, but it did not express either D-mannose-resistant or D-mannose-sensitive hemagglutinins (the main cause of uropathogenicity). They proposed that ABU strains could represent a microbiological approach to prevent urinary tract infections in spinal cord injured patients, and reached the conclusion that E. coli 83972 can be safely used as a long-term asymptomatic bladder colonizer that could successfully prevent the establishment of uropathogenic bacteria. This means that bladder colonization by E. coli 83972 could reduce the incidence of urinary tract infection in patients with neurogenic bladder secondary to spinal cord injury Darouiche and Hull 2000) . Clinical trials demonstrated the feasibility of this technique (Darouiche et al. 2001) , additionally demonstrating that the artificial colonization of urinary catheters by a benign E. coli completely prevented the adhesion and further colonization by not only E. faecalis (Trautner et al. 2002) but also many other uropathogenic species (Trautner et al. 2003 (Trautner et al. , 2005a . The method is currently being improved; by combining it with additional strategies, such as bacteriocin impregnation (Trautner et al. 2007) , increased expression of certain fimbriae (Trautner et al. 2008) , and the addition of agents that prevent biofilm formation (Mansouri et al. 2013 ). This method is expected to be approved in the near future, and will probably represent a powerful weapon to treat UTI in people with spinal cord injuries.', 9], ['Two antigenically related porcine coronaviruses with distinct tissue tropisms (enteric TGEV or respiratory PRCV) provided an ideal model to study interactions between BALT and GALT in the induction of mucosal immunity and protection against the enteropathogenic TGEV strain , Brim et al., 1995 Saif et al., 1994; Van Cott et al., 1993 . Exposure of pigs to TGEV or PRCV results in distinct disease patterns related to differences in tissue tropism between the two viruses Saif and Wesley, 1992; Saif et al., 1994) . TGEV replicates in small intestinal villous epithelial cells, inducing villous atrophy and a malabsorptive diarrhea leading to nearly 100% mortality in seronegative, neonatal pigs. The PRCV strains replicate in the respiratory tract, with little or no replication in the intestine, and generally cause subclinical infections or mild respiratory disease. TGEV infections remain a leading cause of piglet diarrhea and mortality in swine herds and commercial vaccines, even live attenuated oral vaccines, are of limited efficacy in the field (Saif and Wesley, 1992) . In previous studies, PRCV induced partial protection against experimental challenge with TGEV (Van Nieuwstadt et al., 1989; Cox et al., 1993) , but the mechanisms involved were not elucidated. Therefore, we sought to explore the feasibility of using PRCV as a candidate vaccine to prevent TGEV and to use this enteric disease model to delineate the interactions between BALT and GALT in the induction of protective mucosal immunity. Three groups of 1 l-day-old TGEV seronegative pigs were oronasally inoculated with virulent TGEV, PRCV or mock-infected cell-culture fluids, respectively and challenged 24 days later with virulent TGEV , Brim et al., 1995 Saif et al., 1994; Van Cott et al., 1993 . Immune responses in intestinal (gut lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes, MLN), respiratory (bronchial lymph nodes, BLN) and systemic (spleen) lymphoid tissues were assessed at challenge and various post-challenge days by enumeration of IgA and IgG TGEV-specific antibody secreting cells (ASC) by ELISPOT and by lymphoproliferative assays (LPA) using inactivated TGEV as antigen. Our major findings were as follows. All pigs inoculated with TGEV developed diarrhea, shed TGEV in feces and recovered. The presence of high numbers of IgA-ASC in the gut lamina propria and high LPA responses in the MLN at challenge correlated with complete protection against TGEV challenge. No significant increases were observed in numbers of ASC or LPA responses in the gut LP or MLN, respectively, or neutralizing antibody titers in serum after TGEV challenge, reflecting a lack of viral replication associated with complete protection. In contrast, pigs inoculated with PRCV had no clinical disease and shed virus in nasal secretions but not feces. At challenge, the PRCV-exposed pigs had mainly IgG ASC and high LPA responses in the BLN, but low ASC numbers and LPA responses in the intestine (gut LP or MLN, respectively). Only partial protection against diarrhea (42% developed diarrhea) and fecal TGEV shedding was observed. After TGEV challenge, the numbers of IgG-ASC and to a lesser extent, IgA-ASC increased rapidly in the BLN of the PRCV-exposed pigs, suggesting that virus-specific IgG-ASC precursors derived in BALT of the PRCV-exposed pigs may migrate to the intestine in response to TGEV challenge and contribute to the partial protection observed. Interestingly, we found higher numbers of IgA-ASC in BALT of TGEV-exposed pigs than in PRCV-exposed pigs after TGEV challenge, consistent with previous observations indicating trafficking of IgA precursor cells from GALT to BALT (Mestecky, 1987; McGhee et al.. 1992; Husband, 1993) . Thus TGEV replication in the gut may increase the numbers of TGEV-specific IgA-ASC in BALT via trafficking of GALT-derived IgA cells to BALT. One might speculate that TGEV infections or vaccines which induce immunity via GALT and secondarily BALT, may prevent PRCV infections. Whether the more frequent use of live attenuated TGEV vaccines in the US compared with Europe has had an impact on limiting the spread of PRCV infections in the US is unknown, but at present PRCV infections appear to be much more widespread among swine in Europe than in the US. Thus, our major conclusions were that functional compartmentalization exists in the BALT and GALT responses: immunization via BALT (PRCV infection) induced a systemic type of response (IgG-ASC) with low ASC and LPA responses in the gut and provided incomplete protection against an enteric pathogen. Immunization via GALT (TGEV infection) induced high numbers of IgA-ASC and high LPA responses in the gut and provided complete protection against enteric disease. Further studies on the induction and immune regulation of responses to TGEV and PRCV that affect the distribution patterns of ASC and T-lymphocytes should provide important insights to optimize oral vaccine regimens to elicit protective mucosal immune responses against enteric pathogens.', 9], ['Together with Breda virus (Woode et al., 1982) , Lyon IV virus (Moussa et al., 1983) and the particles visualized in human feces (Beards et al., 1984) , Berne virus appears to belong to a new family of enteric animal viruses, provisionally named Toroviridae (Horzinek, 1984) . Replication of Breda virus in gut epithelium has been detected by immunofluorescence (Woode et al., 1982) and thin-section electron microscopy (Pohlenz et al., 1984) . At the present state of knowledge, their properties may be summarized as follows: toroviruses are enveloped RNA viruses containing an elongated tubular nucleocapsid of presumably helical symmetry. The capsid may be bent into an open torus, conferring a disk-or kidney-shaped morphology to the virion (largest diameter 120--140 nm) or it may be straight, resulting in a rod-shaped particle (dimensions 35 × 170 rim). The lipoprotein membrane is studded with projections and a hemagglutinating activity has been demonstrated for Breda virus (Woode et al., 1982) . Major structural proteins of 22 kD and 20 kD have been identified, the latter occurring in the capsid (Horzinek et al., 1985) . Replication is dependent upon some nuclear function of the host cell. Evidence of infection with toroviruses has been obtained in ungulates, lagomorphs, rodents and humans and indication of enteric infection and/or disease, exists for equines, bovines and humans (Horzinek and Weiss, 1984) . The properties described in this paper, e.g. stability at low pH, resistance to trypsin, chymotrypsin and I)OC are in agreement with the ecological niche toroviruses seem to occupy. Their resistance to desiccation would favour their spread in nature.', 9], ['To determine the divergence of the MmelPyV1 isolate genomes (UK and French), we created a whole-genome alignment containing only the two isolates plus the closest related viral species (CSLPyV1) as an outgroup. All three genome positions and almost all regions except the NCCR could be retained (4812 sites). Pairwise genetic distances were calculated using MEGA6 (Tamura et al., 2013) . The date of divergence of the UK and French MmelPyV1 isolates was estimated using previous estimates of polyomavirus substitution rates (Firth et al., 2010) .', 9], [\"This work was supported by the ADEME (Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie), the French environment agency and has been developed by the GRIDEC (Groupe de Recherche Interdisciplinaire sur les D&hets, Grenoble, France). \", 9], ['This study provides useful data for the molecular comprehension of bovine-like CoVs in the canine host. The CoV ecology is intricate due to the number of apparently frequent cross-species jumps that entail its evolution. Indeed, the presence of bovinelike CoVs in dogs was clearly demonstrated in previous studies by serological methods, sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis, but molecular data available to date is incomplete and limited in number. Sequence analysis of the 3 -end of the viral genome showed that strain 240/05 has a genomic organization similar to BCoV, including the presence of the ORFs encoding for the nsp between the S and E protein genes. Although the structural genes are highly conserved among CRCoV strains 240/05 and 4182, the location and number of the accessory genes differ between the two viruses. Moreover, their function in the viral life cycle has not been established yet. In general, as already demonstrated for other CoVs, accessory genes are not essential for replication and their expression could even decrease viral fitness in vitro (Schwarz et al., 1990; Yokomori et al., 1991; Curtis et al., 2002; Ortego et al., 2003; Youn et Yount et al., 2005) . Nevertheless, in field conditions those genes are constantly maintained (Herrewegh et al., 1995; Smits et al., 2005; Dijkman et al., 2006) and their loss is often accompanied by the decline of virulence in the natural host (de Haan et al., 2002; Ortego et al., 2003; Haijema et al., 2004) . CRCoV 240/05 was directly sequenced from the lung sample of a dog allowing the molecular characterization of viral RNA coming straight from field conditions with no adaptation to cell culture. Apparently, in natural conditions the 4.8 kDa protein, strictly maintained in other bovine-like CoVs, was truncated in CRCoV 240/05, and this may be potentially associated to the cross-species transmission and subsequent adaptation of the ancestor BCoV to a different host. However, directly downstream of the S protein gene, CRCoV 4182 possessed a unique 8.8 kDa protein gene, whereas CRCoV G9142 displayed the canonical set of BCoV accessory genes but with the equal truncated form of the 4.8 kDa protein gene as in strain 240/05. Noteworthy, the identical truncated 4.8 kDa terminating codon is present in 240/05, G9142 and in the unique 8.8 kDa corresponding nucleotide sequence of CRCoV strain 4182 (Erles et al., 2007) . Accordingly, more than one BCoV strain or ancestor virus was likely involved in the origin of CRCoV, thus leading to the emergence of different canine strains with a different organizations of the accessory genes. It has been hypothesized that the 4.9 kDa and 4.8 kDa proteins of BCoV may have arisen through mutation from a bovine 11 kDa protein (Abraham et al., 1990) . According to this scenario, CRCoV 4182 may descent from a mutation of an ancestral bovine-like strain that exhibited the full-length 11 kDa protein, whereas CRCoV 240/05 and G9142 presumably descended from a different ancestor that showed the two distinct non-structural proteins. Furthermore, nsp 4.9 and 4.8 are not present in the bovine-derivative HCoV-OC43 (Vijgen et al., 2005) and their function is yet unknown in BCoV itself where the 4.9 kDa protein could not been expressed due to the absence of a start codon in its mRNA (Hofmann et al., 1993) . Obviously, it cannot be ruled out that the elevated level of genomic differences among the accessory genes is due to the high frequency of mutations/deletions that occur during CoV evolution, rather than to RNA recombination events that characterize CoV ecology (Lai et al., 1985; Makino et al., 1986; Banner and Lai, 1991) . Accordingly, all CRCoV strains analyzed so far constantly cluster at the phylogenetic level with extant BCoV strains (Fig. 2) , reinforcing previous suggestions that CRCoV apparently originated as a host variant of BCoV or both viruses descended from a common ancestor. Nevertheless, the elevated level of amino acid similarity with extant bovine-like CoVs characterizing the 12.8 kDa protein suggests a more important role of this protein in viral pathobiology (Erles et al., 2007) . Unfortunately, CRCoV 240/05 could not be propagated in tissue culture probably as a consequence of the long storage of the tissue sample, thus preventing further analysis of viral mRNAs in the context of the infected cells. However, several studies are warranted in order to investigate the effective functionality of the accessory genes in BCoV and CRCoV, thus elucidating the relationship and variations in their expression and the interconnected evolution of highly similar viruses in different hosts.', 9], [\"This agrees with the finding of Newby and Bourne (1976) In older cattle and in other species, transfer to the intestine ,nay also account for a substantial amount of IgG clearance and may contribute to intestinal immunity. The similar half-life of IgG1 in calves and in alder cattle suggests that a similar clearance mechanism is operating (Butler, !983; Nielsen et al., 1978; Husband et al., 1972) . IgG transfer to the intestine has also been reported in other species: mouse (Fubara and Freter, 1972) , rat (Wu and Walker, 1976) , rabbit (Fubara, 1972; Wernet et al., 1976) , dog (Anderson et al., 1963; Pierce and Reyqoldc, 1974) , and sheep Cripps et al., 1974) . In si~eep, Cripps et ~l. (1974) deter:nined that bloodderived IgG makes a significant contribution to the total intestinal IgG. In the dog, radiolabelled IgG transfer into intestinal loops occurred at a rate that explained most [gG clearance (Anderson et al., 1963) . Most major enteropathogen infections result in serum IgG antibody formation as part of the body's immune response. If intestinal transfer is a major route oF serum IgG clearance and if the transferred antibody retains function, serum-derived IgG may make a significant contribution to the intestinal immunity.\", 9]]\n",
